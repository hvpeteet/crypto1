# Cryptography 1
Keeps my solutions for "Cryptography 1" from Stanford offered on Coursera.

## Note about my Rust code
Please don't use my Rust code as a guide for anything!!! I am learning Rust while I am taking this course (so I can learn 2 things at once). If you have Rust pointers or just come across general issues with my code please let me know at hvpeteet@gmail.com or send a pull request, but please don't expect my code in this repo to be a good example of how to use Rust.
